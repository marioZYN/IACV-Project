This project is a simple version of the original Kaggle competition. Instead of dealing with the whole image, we deal with the patches extracted from the whole image. The patch dimension is (96, 96, 3). Demo file uses blob detection to extract the patches from train dotted images.
Note the we use a "manual decision tree style classifier" to classify the dot color. The accuracy is not 100%.
